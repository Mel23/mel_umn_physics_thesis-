You should probably know thesis submission requirements!


Full info is in the graduate handbook: http://zzz.physics.umn.edu/graduate_handbook/after_the_first_year
Rules for the grad school: http://www.grad.umn.edu/current-students-graduate-student-services-progress/thesis-submission

Highlights to know:

## Thesis Document:
Lots of things to submit:
